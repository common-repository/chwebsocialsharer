== Frequently Asked Questions ==
> Find here the Frequently Asked Questions. If your question is not answered look at:

<h4>Why is Facebook only sharing the URL and not the title and description of my page?</h4>
Facebook does not supports custom titles, descriptions and images in its share helper sharer.php but you can use open graph meta tags to show the desired custom formats. 
So if you theme does not suppport open graph meta tags (you see them in the html header as og: tags) use the ChwebSocialShare 

After installation, check with the [Facebook Open graph debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) how Facebook is seeing your site and click on "fetch new data" to purge the Facebook Open Graph cache when your open graph changes are not accepted immediately.
